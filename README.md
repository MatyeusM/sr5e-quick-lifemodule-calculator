# SR5e Life Module Calculator
Personally i am a fan of using the life modules to create organic characters, however it takes
ages adding them together, or using them for character creation. The idea behind this tool was
never to have it being a full character creator, but more like a character mockup, to speed
things up along the way, of using life modules properly.

## Features
### Excluded Features
- **Full Support for Knowledge & Language:** The costumization of language and knowledge skills, i feel is beyond the scope of this little tool.
- **Items:** The tool utilizes packs instead of individual items, simplifying the mockup process.

### Potential Future Features
- **Specializations:** There are few Life Modules that actually give specializations, in which case I just cut them out at the moment. Might change if I implement full support for specializations

### TODO
- Ability to add Skills that are not by default in the rendered list or related to any other skill via a group.
- **Missing Life Modules:** Incorporate Life Modules from 'Run Faster' and other sources as needed.
- **Quality Removal:** Implement the ability to remove qualities you don't want. Or add additional ones.
