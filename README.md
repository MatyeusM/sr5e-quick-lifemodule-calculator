# SR5e Life Module Calculator
Personally i am a fan of using the life modules to create organic characters, however it takes
ages adding them together, or using them for character creation. The idea behind this tool was
never to have it being a full character creator, but more like a character mockup, so I do not
run into issue delivering more organic and diverse characters to players.
